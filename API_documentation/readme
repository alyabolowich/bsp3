HTML and HTML2 API doc. FIles with name oas are OpenAPI 3.0, and without is Swagger 2.0.

There seems to be an error with the arrays and how they get exported. 
All array examples are duplicated, both in the PetStore documentation (reference) and in my files. 
I converted my files to Open API 3.0, and still had the same error (as did PetStore for OpenAPI 3.0).

When I open one of the html files from PetStore, I see in the HTML that the code has been duplicated.
I think there is an error in how Swagger processes the documents.
